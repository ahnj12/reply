# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> Just using the given examples was very helpful in figuring out how to use the library.  I first ran each of the given examples and then took a look at the code to see how it was doing everything.  Because there were already many examples showing how to use the module, it was very easy to create my own examples because I could use the given examples as references.  The code was organized fairly well and the method names did a good job of explaining what the code did without the use of comments.  Explaning some of the more confusing conditionals might have made it easier to figure out all the logic.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Trying to generalize as much as possible and avoiding any sort of implementation detail.  Essentailly making it as easy as possible for people to reuse my code without have to read every line to know how it works.  I would tell the new CS142 student to assume that the reader doesn't know anything about coding and that would help the student from talking about any of the implementation and say at the high level.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 3 hours.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I recieved help from looking at the homework discussion board on Slack.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> No significant problems. Any issues I ran into were addressed in the Slack discussion board.
